# Recorder

Really simple tool to record speedtests and display them in a graph. Might develop this further but as of right now this is good enough.

# Commands
To make a singular test type `npm start`. To make tests in a certain interval use `npm run start_interval <seconds>` instead.

In order to see the overview use `npm run serve` to start the server.
